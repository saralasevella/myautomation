**Selenium-Facebook Automation experiments**
In this repo we have 3 test cases writtent in Selenium they execute following actions;

**#First Test Case:** Opens facbook in a browser and enters user id and password lastly clicks logon and close the browser. ( I have included dummy user and password in the code which does not work, if you are executing this please use valid user id and password).

**#Second Test Case:** In this Test Scenario we open facebook in a webbrowser and click on forgot password and enters value and close.

**#Third Test Case:** In this Test scenario we open a facebook in a webbrowser and clicks on create a business page and closed the browser.

Finally We can execute them Sequentially!!

#We can also do a sequential execution of above three test cases using TestNG sequential execution. To create the testng.xml using eclipse select all the test cases you want to run sequentially and right click and select convert to testng and click on finish. 

This will create testng.xml file which you can use to execute all the above 3 cases sequentially.
